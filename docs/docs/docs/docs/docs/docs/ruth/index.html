his plan for a ‘second chance society’, the movement to decrease the lengths of prison sentences for youths held on drug-related charges has been gaining momentum among state representatives and senators.</p> <p>“We incarcerate the population way too often for a problem that should be addressed by offering aid for an addiction,” said State Representative Matthew Ritter who has been a supporter of Malloy’s plans and legislative actions to decrease the sentencing for youth who have been arrested.</p> <p>“Staying in jail for three years instead of getting help just means our incarcerated population is increasing.”</p> <p>Data released by the state of Connecticut show that a majority of incarcerated youth are being detained for drug-related charges while more serious charges such as violent crime are in the minority.</p> <iframe width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"

adjusted to populations size, the data shows that towns such as Sprague and Deep River had reports of the highest levels of violent crime while Greenwich and Fairfield have the lowest violent crime rates.</p> <p>A total of 99 towns reported zero violent crime, though data collected by the state of Connecticut did not specify whether violent crimes in those ares were truly so insignificant or whether existing crime was simply not reported.</p> <p><strong>Violent crime in Connecticut</strong></p> <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0"

msallowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>A second map shows the frequency of arrests for drug use among youths during that same year.</p> <p>The towns of Caanan and Sharon had the highest arrest rates for drug use while Groton and Bridgeport were among towns with the least arrests.</p> <p><strong>Arrests for drug use in Connecticut</strong></p> <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0"

msallowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>The hefty price of incarceration is increasingly becoming a concern for taxpayers. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, people who have been arrested for drug use make up 48.7 percent of the U.S. prison population.</p> <p>The National Association of State Budget Officers reports that taxpayers spend an average total of $50 billion annually for state prisons.</p> <p>Connecticut spent an average of $50,262 annually per incarcerated citizen — the third highest average of the 40 states that participated in a study from the VERA institute of Justice in 2012.</p> <p>The study determined the total cost per prisoner for each state taking into account the sum spent between both adult prisoners and detained youths.</p> <p><strong>Price per inmate</strong></p> <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://ruthbruno.cartodb.com/viz/63995930-9bf1-11e5-95ae-0ecfd53eb7d3/embed_map" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>“I think people are beginning to realize how expensive it is to put juveniles away into detention centers,” said Ritter.</p> <p>Connecticut is not the only state looking to minimize penalties for people who have used drugs. New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Delaware were among the 11 total states that have repealed or shortened the mandatory sentence for non-violent residents arrested for drug possession. A poll conducted in 2014 shows that 63 percent of Americans favored these changes in state drug laws, while 32 percent opposed the repeals.</p> <p>“We are beginning to see that these ‘get tough on crime initiatives introduced in the ‘80’s haven’t been working, to continue the same approach would be a bad idea, continued Ritter.”</p> <p>Senator Gary Winfield argues that this type of “harsh” treatment towards drug use only contributes to the problem. “We don’t want the people who have served their time and redeemed themselves to be stuck unable to be employed. That only leads them right back into the system,” said Winfield.</p> <p>Abby Anderson, executive director of the Office of the Child Advocate, says “Often there are underlying problems before a child enters the juveile traning school, either problems at home or at school or what have you.” Anderson added that once they been placed in a training school or detention center, youths often begin using drugs once they are out and are arrested again.</p> <p>“I don’t know that there’s proof either way in Connecticut to show whether it’s benefitting or harming youth,” said Anderson. “Certainly, on a national level, we’ve seen that incarceration has not been successful, but there are not collective records of how it affects children later in life. “</p> <p>Anderson states that that there are also often no records are kept to show which child has been treated for addiction or other illneses while in a training school. “The data produced is hard to parse out.”</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="previous" href="/au-spring-18/welcome-to-jekyll/">Welcome to Jekyll! &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/au-spring-18/images/ruth1.png" alt="Majority of a youth in detention centers held on charges of drug use"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/au-spring-18/welcome-to-jekyll/">Welcome to Jekyll!</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;13 Jun 2016</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/au-spring-18/usage/">Usage Guide</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Jun 2016</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/au-spring-18/elements/">Elements</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Jun 2016</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/au-spring-18/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
